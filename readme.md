##Why did you choose this subject?  How were you first made aware of it?
We first heard of it when Jessie mentioned it earlier.  After learning about Websockets it sounded interesting.
##What problem does it solve?
* Rapid development (integrated JavaScript libraries for both server and client)
* Code works on multiple platforms (can compile versions for IOS and Android)
* Works and plays well with others (Works with Android and other frameworks)
* Reactive technology builds fast applications (sends data across the wire, not HTML).
##Why does one use it?
* Build real-time apps using JavaScript, which lots of people know
* Real-time syncing of data on different devices
* Fairly fast learning curve
##What are the alternatives?
socket.io or express.io can do some of these things, but don't seem to be as comprehensive.
##What is it similar to, if anything?
It has elements of everything we've touched on here in WDI.  The file folder structure looks like Rails or Angular, the templates are like Angular partials.
##What is the history of this technology?
* First introduced in December 2011 under the name Skybreak.
* First actual shipment late 2012.  
##Who built it and why?
Building enterprise-level web apps takes too long and the results are too slow.  They wanted build something that worked quickly and could be developed quickly by people who knew JavaScript.
The founders of the company include people with a lot of startup experience:
* Geoff Schmidt, inventor of audio fingerprinting, original author of Miro (decentralized Web TV), co-founder of MixApp, and early employee at Asana.
* Matt DeBergalis, the founder and operator of fundraising platform ActBlue
* Nick Martin, built the infrastructure behind Mochi Media, co-founded MixApp  with Schmidt
* David Greenspan, the author of Etherpad, which he sold to Google before going to work on Google Wave and Google App Engine.
##Who is maintaining it?
The product was developed by the Meteor company, who are still maintaining it.  Schmidt, DeBergalis, and Martin are still there.  The source is maintained on GitHub and they accept contributions from the open source community.  
##What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
It's very fast and once someone becomes used to the structure I can see how it could be used for very rapid development.
##What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
A lot of moving parts (templates, scripts, scripts that call templates, templates that require script, etc.)
